the question:
Prove that the set L = {X ⊆ N: |X| ≤ 3} is countably infinite. Your solution should either give a bijective function f : N → L or give pseudo-code of a program that prints all the values of such a function, in the following format (in this case you don’t have to define f explicitly, but need to also show the first five lines of output):
0: element of L
1: another element of L
2: yet another element of L ...
